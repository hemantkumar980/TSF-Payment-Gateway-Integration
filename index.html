        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">At The Life You Can Save, we make “smart giving simple” by recommending charities that save lives and improve well-being where each dollar goes the furthest. Every day, approximately 15,000 children under
          five die. A staggering 80% of those deaths occur in the poorest regions on the planet — and most of them are preventable. When you donate to effective children’s charities, you’re creating a world where all kids survive and thrive.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Giving money to those in need can be a personally satisfying experience, but there is a choice between donating nationally and internationally through charities or giving directly to those around you. There
          are advantages, however, in giving to charities that are national and international. First and foremost there is the choice of good causes. Locally the kinds of places to help may be limited, but in larger organisations you can get involved
          in such activities as sponsoring a child or conserving wildlife. </p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Become a Volunteer.</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A volunteer is someone who willingly offers their services to an organization. Volunteering is mainly done to help other people in need and to give back to society. Volunteering activities are of different
          types, for instance, skill-based volunteering, micro-volunteering, emergency volunteering, online volunteering, etc. Social organizations are always in need of enthusiastic volunteers who can contribute their time and skills to their
          different programs and serve the community at large. Volunteering helps you build interpersonal skills and accelerates your personal growth. You tend to become a good listener and a good speaker. You become sensitive towards other people’s
          needs. Your contribution of time and skills helps someone find a new hope for their future.</p>
